A special moment in Frothers history, as both Nick, Chris, Lance and Jamie marked 50 games for the boys.

A Frothers team devoid of strikers faced off against the Marauders. After conceding two stumble goals in a quiet first hour the Frothers rallied and poured the pressure on.

Big cat Stu popped up with his first goal in two seasons, really putting the pressure on big daddy Chester to get on the scorecard.

With all the pressure, it was too little too late and the game ended 2-1.

**Player of the Day:**

Jamie, for putting in a huge shift of running and never quitting.

**Dick of the Day:**

Jarrod, for finally dusting off the boots and doubling his minutes this season. This included a goal mouth miss worthy of Raheem with an excuse about the ball being at "knee height".
