Ronaldo‘s or Rosario’s?

After a week when the Scouse finally reached the Premier League promised land, the mighty Frothers also returned from the wilderness with an Istanbul comeback for the ages.  
After a run of three games without a win and a couple of drubbings, it looked like it might be a similar story again when their paunchy opponents Sudakas took an early lead.

A minor slip up from a short-corner, gifted the opposition no. 10 more time and space than Demba Ba in front of the Kop, and he duly took advantage by swirling a high ball into the Wellington wind which dipped under the bar.

In what looked to be wetter and wilder conditions than a night out with Ribery and Benzema, things soon turned from bad to worse for Frothers as they spurned a couple of gilt edged chances to equalise.

Following a strong period of pressure up top and with the goal bag begging to be stuffed, Frother’s no. 10 Rosario the elder did just that. With the goal gaping he cut inside like R9, only to try a spicy one-two with the corner flag from distance, which would have made Andy Carroll look good. Not to be outdone by a Liverpool fan, Molyneaux soon snatched at a chance of his own when he had more time to burn than Fergie in stoppage, but lifted over the bar.

Things soon went from bad to worse for the Froth, when the Sudakas' striker hit another high-arcing rainbow, teeing up the wind for its second goal of the game. With a two goal margin snagged, the opposition started to get both cocky and mouthy (never a good combo). After some whispered bating by R9 and a few talking-to’s from the ref, they almost came unstuck when they tried to spring the off side trap from their own half.

The younger Rosario (CR7) was quickly onto it and through on goal, but with the Hatch wide open to his left, he went for the typical Ronnie glory and failed to find the hole between the keepers legs who pulled off a nifty save with his feet. The final action of a whirlwind first period, culminated in Molyneaux being hacked down inside the area as he went to pull the trigger - but the ref was having none of it.

Half Time - Wind 2, Frothers 0...

Heartened by their slew of missed chances, the Frother’s emerged for the second half changed men. Captain for the day Hanson continued to battle harder than his namesake Alan with a man of the match display, and Milan was more AC’s Pirlo than a head-down Baros in holding down the midfield.

With the central areas bossed and Sudakas tiring, the Froth started to turn the screw. A long ball over the top found CR7 Rosario running through unchecked and he released an unstoppable Ronnie rocket into the top corner, which left injury prone Chester Matip screaming baby girl!

Not long after, Ronnie was in again this time with a wonky cross that had the goalie flapping under his own bar and gave R9 Rosario the chance to throw his hard earned weight around and equalise with a torpedo of a header. With Jack Van Diijk imperious at the back and Charlie Lovren wisely staying away from his calamity of a left foot, the solid Froth smelt blood and got their rewards late in the game.

After some pinball in the box, the ref soon made up for not awarding the Froth a blatant penalty in the first half by giving a soft handball. R9 Rosario was quick to grab the ball and showed his big game cohones as he drilled the ball into the net harder, sending the Froth support into rapture.

The drama wasn’t done yet though, as a mistimed tackle gave Sudakas a chance to whip a free kick in on goal with the last few minutes ebbing away. On a hat trick, the Sudakas no. 10 curled one for the far corner, but Ryan Dudek pulled off a top draw save to tip the effort round the post.

With what was the last kick of the game, the ball was in the net again from the resulting corner, but chalked off after the Sudakas centre mid clattered through a few Froth bodies. Finally fed up with all the opposition's pissing and moaning, the ref called it early and the Ascot Park ditch ran blue with pure Froth.
