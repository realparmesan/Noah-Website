The Frothers ran out at Ascot Park against the Marauders to try and turn the tide of the season.

After a glorious start, several errors around the goal mouth meant the Frothers went into the break 2-1 down. In a heavy second half in the heat, the game ended 3-2 to the Marauders after a Frothers penalty and a late winner to the Marauders.

**Man of the Match:**

Bombing the line all match and having a being rewarded with a goal for great poachers instincts, Jamie.
