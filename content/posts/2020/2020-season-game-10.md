Keeping the unbeaten streak alive, the Frothers put together a great showing against the 2nd placed Tuscan Raiders.

Coming out the gates fast, Jamie hatch flicked on a delicious header to Harry Furnish to calmly slotted into the back of the net.

The rest of the half was tightly contested and Frothers went into the break 1-0.

The second half began and the raiders dominated play and eventually equalised through a blatant offside.

Feeling bad about the goal they had just scored the Raiders, after and 20 minutes or so, fed Yarride a delightful through-ball onto their own goal. Yarride decided to turn it up and go for the elite finish off both posts to bring the Frothers up.

The Raiders then poured on the pressure and finally finalised through the traitor, OG.

**Player of the Day:**

The man between the sticks, Ryan. Made plenty of quality saves and looked composed behind almost every shot.

**Dick of the Day:**

With a strong performance, Jack succumbed to the allure of the OG and equalised it up for the Raiders.
